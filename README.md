# Neural NetworksUnleashed

A self project repository focusing on neural networks and their implementations.

This repository contains a collection Neural Network models focused on various aspects of data categorization and prediction. Each folder contains a specific project with detailed explanations, code, and results. Below is an overview of each project.

## ANN from Scratch
This project involves implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to understand the inner workings of neural networks by building them without any high-level libraries.

## GANs in Python

This project explores Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and its application to generate images of random digits. The GAN is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. I have used PyTorch to implement the GAN in Python.

## RNN Name Generation

In this, I have trained a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate names based on a provided dataset of dinosaur names. The RNN learns the patterns and structures of the given names and generates new and similar names. For example, we can provide specific prefixes to generate names too.

## NGram Model for Hangman

Finally, created an N-gram model to play the popular Hangman game. The N-gram model predicts the next character in a sequence, at every stage of the game. The goal is to make the model guess, with most efficiency, the correct letters in the word and eventually win the game.
